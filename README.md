distance_map
============

This one-page web application takes in a list of employees and a list of employers and
calculates commute time to potential employers. 

It is designed to be run from your local computer, requires a mapquest
developer key, and properly formatted formatted files which can be uploaded
using the ajax interface.

A map is created with everyone pinned onto an interactive map. Commute time is 
calculated using average estimated traffic. Detailed information for each 
permutation is also displayed in a sortable table.
